# apex-flowsforAPEX-taskInbox
A Task Inbox application for Flows for APEX

This project creates a Task Inbox application in APEX for the Flows for APEX project.

This is designed to be a small (1-2 page) app that users have as a starting point when they are using several other APEX apps that have been instrumented for Flows for APEX.  

- The Task Inbox shows you tasks that are currently waiting for you to work on.

- The My Processes Summary shows you the current status of any process instances that you originated.

## Dependancies

Currently supports Flows for APEX V5.0.1
